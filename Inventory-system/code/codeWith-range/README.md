# Inventory-system


Problem statement:
Suppose that the maximum inventory level or stock limitation, M is 11 units and the review period or reordering point, N is 5 days. The problem is to estimate, by simulation, the average ending units in inventory and the average number of days when a shortage condition occurs.


The simulation has been started with the initial inventory level at 3 units and an order of 8 units scheduled to arrive after one day.
Total Simulation Time: 25 days;

Here we use random number range to know daily demand and lead time (how many days need to get order / prodect)

I provide two excel sheet ,from where we know the demand and lead time using range.
